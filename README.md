AUTOMATIC CITY GENERATOR :)

TO RUN THE PROJECT
    install blender
    open GENERATOR.blend
    click the "Run Script" button no the bottom of the python code window

you can also use the "CLEANUP", "BLOCKS" and "OK" in the F3 search

I downloaded some of the 3d models for this project from blendswap.com, special thanks to Daniel74 :)
all of the licenses of the used models can be found in the "Licenses" folder

I know the project might seam unorganized, but it was written for blender 2.7 , made some cuts and changes to run it on 2.8.
